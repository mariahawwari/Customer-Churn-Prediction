# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction

This is a beginner-friendly machine learning project that predicts whether a customer will leave a telecom company (churn) based on their service usage and personal information.

## 📌 Problem

Customer churn is when customers stop doing business with a company. For telecom companies, it's important to know in advance who is likely to leave so they can take action.

## 📁 Dataset

We use the "Telco Customer Churn" dataset from Kaggle:

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Project Steps

1. Load and explore the dataset
2. Clean the data
3. Perform basic visualizations
4. Build and train ML models
5. Evaluate performance (accuracy, confusion matrix)

## ✅ Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier

## 📈 Results

Achieved ~80% accuracy on test data using Random Forest.  
Next steps may include hyperparameter tuning or using XGBoost.

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies  
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the notebook `churn_prediction.ipynb`
